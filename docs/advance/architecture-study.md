# I would like to study more on the architecture, where should I go ?

::: tip
If you are not not familiar machine learning, I would recommend [Andrej Karpathy series on neural networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ&ab_channel=AndrejKarpathy) - this would help provide a good foundation on various neural network architectures concepts.

A good starting point, is to look into [RWKV in 150 lines of code](https://github.com/BlinkDL/ChatRWKV/blob/main/RWKV_in_150_lines.py), which is a good starting point to understand the core concepts of RWKV.

Alternatively, you can study it up via the [RWKV paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13048)

Once you gotten a grasp on the fundemantals, you can start studying the training and cuda code respectively in the [main repo](https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM)
